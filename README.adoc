= Scheme index
:toc: left

Scheme index is a tool for indexing and searching through procedures and syntax from Scheme specifications and select SRFI libraries.
The index may be used through a site (https://index.scheme.org) or through REST API.

== Userguide for site visitors

Scheme index search consists of control pane on the left, and result list in the center. 

=== Control pane

In the control pane, optionally select values from the filter list, optionally enter search query in the text field, and press either enter or button with magnifying glass to display the results. You can use control + f to quickly focus to the query text field.

=== Result list

Each result item is either a procedure, a macro, or a value. At the top it shows a library it is exported from. Identifiers that are exported from multiple libraries will appear in the result list multiple times. The library name can be clicked, which will result in starting new search using said library as a filter. On the right side top, associated list of tags with the result is shown. Tags are also clickable, and start a search using the clicked tag as a filter.

Procedures and value names are rendered in *red*. Procedures are distinguished by being surrounded with parenthesis, as if being called. Following the name until the "=>" sign are parameters. If parameter is just a name, it means it has an unspecified type. Otherwise, parameter may be a list of type and name. Types are usually represented as predicate procedures (sometimes a type may be opaque or logical, and without a disjoint predicate function to distinguish it). It can also be a logical "or" of multiple types, separated by `/`. Sometimes `#f` literal is used as a type due to its significant role in scheme to act what would be `null` elsewhere. 

After the "=>" sign is the return type. The return type is same as parameter type, and additionally may contain: 

* a "*" symbol (meaning it returns a value of unknown type); 

* a list with "values" word in car position (meaning it has a multivalue return); 

Types expressed as predicates in *blue* are links. Pressing on a type in parameter position will search using that type as *return value* filter; pressing on a type in return value position will search using that type as *parameter* filter.

If one of parameters or return value is *procedure?*, *list?*, *vector?*, its signature might be further elaborated below the main procedure's signature.

Procedures can have more than one entry, even from same library. This occurs, if the procedures is has optional parameters and therefore can be called in multiple ways; or if the result type can be determined more precisely under more specific input parameters.

Macros are rendered in *green*. If macro is complex, some parts of it are grouped, and the syntax of those groups shown below the syntax of whole macro. Macro literals are also rendered in green. To make parenthesis more obvious, auxiliary parenthesis coloring is used, however this coloring doesn't signify any information.

=== Tags

Result items might have one or more of following tags

* pure - this procedure is referentially transparent (as long as whatever procedure parameters it has are also referentially transparent). Procedures that return undefined value cannot be marked as pure;
* predicate - this procedure that takes any object and returns a boolean. Such procedure may be used as a type;
* parameter - this procedure was created with "make-parameter" and may be used in parameterize form;
* deprecated - not recommended to be used, exists only for backwards compatibility with older SRFIs.

=== Filtering logic

Selecting multiple libraries, will return results that are part of *any* of the given libraries.

Selecting multiple tags, will return results that contain *all* of the given tags.

Selecting multiple parameter types will return results that match *all* of the given types. 

Some types contain logical "parent" / more general types, eg. *number?* is a parent of *integer?*. When searching by parameter type, the procedures that take parent type will be matched. However, the results with more precise "child" type are weight more heavily and should appear at the start of the search.

Some types are defined as a union of other types; for example *list?* is a union of *pair?* and *null?*. If loose parameter filtering is enabled under settings, the composing parts will be treated as parent of union type; ie searching for *list?* you'd be also presented with procedures applicable to *pair?*. On one hand this presents extra results you might be interested, on the other hand those results might not be applicable in general case.

Selecting multiple return types will return results that match *all* of the given types. As and in case filter by parameter type, when filtering by return type the type hierarchy is taken into consideration. Searching by a "parent" return type will also yield procedures returning more precise "child" types.

The text query is parsed by edismax parser (read more about it https://solr.apache.org/guide/6_6/the-dismax-query-parser.html#the-dismax-query-parser), and is used to filter by name and parameter / subsyntax names. This means it supports and interprets common searching syntax, such as using "-" in front of the word to exclude results containing said word. This has its disadvantages; eg. if you tried to search for coercion functions and typed "->string" (without quotes) into the search input field, you wouldn't find anything interesting, because the leading minus was interpreted specially. Instead, you'd have to search using "exact phrase", by putting double quotes around the search.


== Obtaining and running index yourself

=== Download

Prebuilt versions are available at https://github.com/arvyy/r7rs-index-site/releases

Docker image (always corresponding to latest deployed version) may be pulled from `arvyy/scheme-index:master`.

=== Building native

Build processes requires following tools on path:

* `ant` - Apache Ant build tool

* `mvn` - Apache maven project tool

* `asciidoctor` - Asciidoctor documentation compiler

* `sass` - SCSS compiler

* (optional) `npm` - nodejs / npm tooling to build CLI client application.

You can build scheme index by running `ant` from the root of the source directory. Pass `-DbuildClient=true` to include CLI client application build.

After the build successfully completes, you should find everything scheme index needs in `dist` directory.

=== Running native

Once you have obtained a built version, you can run it using:

```
java -jar scheme-index.jar
```

Note that working directory is important; type files, configuration are resolved relative to the working dir, not relative to jar file.

See <<Configuration>> section for configuring the application behavior.

=== Building docker image

Build a docker image using

```
docker build -t scmindex-builder:latest -f docker/base/Dockerfile .
docker build -t scheme-index -f docker/scheme-index/Dockerfile .
```

The built image has same structure as a native build, under path `/app` inside the image.

=== Running docker image

To run with docker, execute

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --init scheme-index
```

The application resides in `/app` location. Consult rest of the documentation for details, but in particular you might want to mount a volume 
to `/app/logs` to catch log files, or a volume file to `/app/config/configuration.scm` to overwrite index config.

=== Running in development

First, install dependencies under kawa-web-collection submodule (make sure the git submodule is initialized / updated)

```
cd kawa-web-collection
mvn install
```

Afterwards, run the application with

```
mvn kawa:run
```

Launch sass compiler with

```
sass -w src/main/scss/main.scss static/css/scmindex.css
```

== Configuration

=== configuration.scm

Core application behavior is managed using a scm configuration file, containing a list of key-value pairs, where each key is a symbol (ie. an alist).
Running the application, first argument is interpreted as a path to configuration file. If not set, it defaults to `./config/configuration.scm`

The following is exhaustive list of valid properties
[cols="1l,3,1l"]
|===

| "config/downloads.scm"
|===

=== Identifiers definitions

Identifiers definitions are grouped into files (mostly one for each library), and a single root index file which defines names and paths to those files.
The index file is specified in configuration under `spec-index` property, with a default value "./types/index.scm".

Index should be a list of pairs - where `car` is a symbolic library name, and `cdr` is associated information regarding definitions to load from. `cdr` may be an alist, with following fields:

* `'file` - path from where to load definitions.

* `'exclude` - a list of definitions to ignore from the file. 

Alternatively, `cdr` might be a string, in which case it's treated as a file path.

```
(
    ((scheme base) . "types/scheme.base.scm")
    ((scheme r5rs) . ((file . "types/r5rs.scm")
                      (exclude . (transcript-on transcript-off))))
)
```

Each definitions file is a list of entries, where each entry is an association list, using symbols as keys. An entry may be defining a function, a syntax macro, or a plain value.

[cols="1m,3a"]
|===
| key 
| description

| name
| The name of the function / syntax / value. The name doesn't have to be unique - in particular with procedures, definition is repeated for all possible invocation overloads with different parameter counts. Required.

| signature
| S-expr defining signature. The format depends on a type (function / syntax / value) being described.

== Function

In case of function, the format is either `(lambda (<parameter> ...) <return type>)` or `(case-lambda ((<parameter> ...) <return type>) ...)`.

Each parameter is either of the form `(<type> param-name)` or just `param-name`, when type is "any". Each parameter may be succeeded by a `...` literal to indicate varargs / repetition.

Parameter type is either:

* a predicate name (eg. `list?`);

* a type union in the form of `(or <type> ...)` (eg. `(or list? number?)`). When using `or`, `#f` might be used as a type inside of it due to its common appearance as a "null" value.

Return type can be same as parameter type described above, plus:

* `undefined`, indicating a value that shouldn't be used in portable code (eg. result of `for-each`);

* `*`, indicating a useful value but of unknown type.

* `(values <type> ...)` form when the function returns more than one value.

== Syntax

In case of syntax, the format is `(syntax-rules (<keyword> ...) (<pattern> <optional-return-type>) ...)`

Pattern should be: symbol, `.`, `...`, or grouping of patterns inside `()`. If optional return type is provided, it describes
the resultant type when syntax is used as an expression. As a hatch to rendering outside of parens, use `(_append )` form, which concatenates its arguments.

== Value

In case of simple value, the format is `(value <type>)`

where type is same as described under functions.

| tags
| A list of symbols. Tags don't have inherent special treatment (ie., definition can make use of any tag it wants). 
Currently used tags are described in <<Tags>>

| subsigs
| Additional elaboration of signatures for the parameters / returns / syntax fragments / datastructure content. Each entry in this list is a list,
 where first element is a name (corresponding to parameter / syntax fragment / etc), and second parameter is its signature. The signature can be either 
one of as described in `signature` section, as well as additionally: 

* `(pattern <pattern> ...)` - describes subsyntax pattern, expanding template variables used in main signature of the syntax;

* `(alist <car> <cdr>)` - describes an alist datastrucutre, where `<car>` and `<cdr>` has same format as function parameter definition;

* `(list <element>)` - describes an list datastrucutre, where `<element>` has same format as function parameter definition;

* `(vector <element>)` - describes an list datastrucutre, where `<element>` has same format as function parameter definition;

| syntax-param-signatures
| Applicable only to syntax type. The value is a list, where each element is itself a 2 element list. First element is a symbol, matching one of the symbols in the signature.
Second argument is parameter type definition, as described under functions. This allows annotating syntax when it expects to receive values of certain types for specific places in the pattern. 

| parameterized-by
| List of strings, denoting parameters created by `make-parameter` that influence behavior of this entry

| spec-values
| Sometimes procedures have very limited input set for specific parameter (eg. using symbols as a union). Sometimes procedures handle values with specific logic when it detects specific format in it (eg. printf format specifier). In both cases it's sensible to list these special handlings, and this is what this field is for. The value of spec-values is an alist, where car corresponds to parameter name, and cdr is a list. Each element in said list is also a list - where first element corresponds to specific value (written as a string), and cadr corresponds to the value's description (also a string).

|===

=== Filterset definitions

Filterset is a coarse filter, and defines which libraries to include (and optionally how to rename them). Filterset definitions are structured into files one for each filterset option, and a single root index file which defines names and paths to those files.

The index file is specified in configuration under `filterset-index` property, with a default value "./filters/index.scm".

Index should be a list of alists. Each alist contains three fields:

* `code` - used in links;

* `name` - displayed text;

* `file` - associated filterset definition file.

Filterset definition file should be a list of pairs. `car` is a symbolic library name (matching what is defined in index for identifiers definitions). `cdr` is either a symbolic library name (in which case, all the usages of library in `car` are renamed to what is in `cdr`), or a `#t` value (indicating to include library in `car` as is, without a rename).

=== Logging

Scheme index uses logback for logging. By default (as defined in `src/main/resources/logback.xml`) it only does rolling file logging into `./logs` directory, and not into standard output.
You can provide custom logging configuration by running

```
java -Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml -jar scheme-index.jar
```

Consult logback documentation for details.

== REST API

All of the following endpoints accept `wt` query parameter.
If the parameter's value is `sexpr`, the results are returned as if with `write`, using scheme-json convention
as defined in srfi 180. Otherwise, results are returned as json.

=== `/rest/filterset`

List of filtersets as strings. For all endpoints below, `{filterset name}` must correspond to one of the values returned here.
