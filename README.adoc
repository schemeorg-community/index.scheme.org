= Scheme index
:toc: left

Scheme index catalogs definitions of procedures, macros, values from scheme specifications and SRFI libraries, using sexpr textual format. Main points of interests is the `types` folder.
This repository also provides complementary static site GUI. It's accessible at https://index.scheme.org . 

== Identifiers definitions

Identifiers definitions are grouped into files (one file for each library) under `types/*.scm`, and a single root index file which defines names and paths to those files `types/index.scm`.

Index file is a list of pairs - where `car` is a symbolic library name, and `cdr` is associated information regarding definitions to load from. `cdr` may be an alist, with following fields:

* `'file` - path from where to load definitions.

* `'exclude` - a list of definitions to ignore from the file. 

Alternatively, `cdr` might be a string, in which case it's treated as a file path.

```
(
    ((scheme base) . "types/scheme.base.scm")
    ((scheme r5rs) . ((file . "types/r5rs.scm")
                      (exclude . (transcript-on transcript-off))))
)
```

Each library definition file is a list of entries, where each entry is an association list, using symbols as keys. Each entry either describes a group of identifiers, or a single identifier. 

Group has following properties:

[cols="1m,3a"]
|===
| key
| description

| group
| A list of identifiers under the group. Each entry must have format as described under a table for single idenfier entry.

| desc
| A textual description applicable for entire group
|===

Single identifier has following properties:

[cols="1m,3a"]
|===
| key 
| description

| name
| The name of the function / syntax / value. The name doesn't have to be unique - in particular with procedures, definition is repeated for all possible invocation overloads with different parameter counts. Required.

| signature
| S-expr defining signature. The format depends on a type (function / syntax / value) being described.

== Function

In case of function, the format is either `(lambda (<parameter> ...) <return type>)` or `(case-lambda ((<parameter> ...) <return type>) ...)`.

Each parameter is either of the form `(<type> param-name)` or just `param-name`, when type is "any". Each parameter may be succeeded by a `...` literal to indicate varargs / repetition.

Parameter type is either:

* a predicate name (eg. `list?`);

* a type union in the form of `(or <type> ...)` (eg. `(or list? number?)`). When using `or`, `#f` might be used as a type inside of it due to its common appearance as a "null" value.

Return type can be same as parameter type described above, plus:

* `undefined`, indicating a value that shouldn't be used in portable code (eg. result of `for-each`);

* `*`, indicating a useful value but of unknown type.

* `(values <type> ...)` form when the function returns more than one value.

== Syntax

In case of syntax, the format is `(syntax-rules (<keyword> ...) (<pattern> <optional-return-type>) ...)`

Pattern should be: symbol, `.`, `...`, or grouping of patterns inside `()`. If optional return type is provided, it describes
the resultant type when syntax is used as an expression. As a hatch to rendering outside of parens, use `(_append )` form, which concatenates its arguments.

== Value

In case of simple value, the format is `(value <type>)`

where type is same as described under functions.

| tags
| A list of symbols. Tags don't have inherent special treatment (ie., definition can make use of any tag it wants). 
Currently used tags are described in <<Tags>>

| subsigs
| Additional elaboration of signatures for the parameters / returns / syntax fragments / datastructure content. Each entry in this list is a list,
 where first element is a name (corresponding to parameter / syntax fragment / etc), and second parameter is its signature. The signature can be either 
one of as described in `signature` section, as well as additionally: 

* `(pattern <pattern> ...)` - describes subsyntax pattern, expanding template variables used in main signature of the syntax;

* `(alist <car> <cdr>)` - describes an alist datastrucutre, where `<car>` and `<cdr>` has same format as function parameter definition;

* `(list <element>)` - describes a list datastrucutre, where `<element>` has same format as function parameter definition;

* `(vector <element>)` - describes a vector datastrucutre, where `<element>` has same format as function parameter definition.

| desc
| Textual description.

== Filterset definitions

Filterset is a coarse filter, and defines which libraries to include (and optionally how to rename them). Filterset definitions are structured into files one for each filterset option under `filters/*.scm`, and a single root index file which defines names and paths to those files `filters/index.scm`.

Index should be a list of alists. Each alist contains three fields:

* `code` - used in links;

* `name` - displayed text;

* `file` - associated filterset definition file.

Filterset definition file should be a list of pairs. `car` is a symbolic library name (matching what is defined in index for identifiers definitions). `cdr` is either a symbolic library name (in which case, all the usages of library in `car` are renamed to what is in `cdr`), or a `#t` value (indicating to include library in `car` as is, without a rename).

== Compiling / running static site GUI

=== Native

Open `build` directory and execute `bash build.sh`. Requires:

. Chicken scheme compiler, with json, matchable and srfi 1 eggs installed;
. Nodejs / npm installation.

After building, you'll find `schemeindex.zip` in build directory, which you can unzip and deploy from any web server. If you plan serving not from root, edit `index.html` file and change `<base href=".">` to point to appropriate prefix.

=== Docker compose

Open `build` directory and execute `docker compose up`. The site will be available at `localhost:8080`.
